        <blockquote> <b>Is Unacademy better than Aakash ?</b> <br>
            I've used both Aakash iTutor LIVE & Unacademy, so its better you make your decesion upon my opinion.
             There's no way Aakash LIVE can compete with Unacademy. Unacademy is best in its way of delivering
              the best quality education from the best teachers in India and also in a much much lesser cost*.</blockquote>
